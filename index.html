    <br>

    <h3 class="backwhite">The Beginning Of Erva Mate</h3>

    <p class="backwhite">The first to discover and cultivate of the Erva Mate tree were the Guarani people, between the Uruguay and the Paraguay river basins in South America, most likely in the north-east of Argentina, but there is no known date for it's first use by the Guarani, as oral traditions are a difficult source to speculate time from. But a nice source of oral traditions is a legend on how they may have discovered it:</p>
    <div class="backwhite">
    <p>
        “A nomadic tribe had set themselves on a large hill of the Serras where the Tabay rivers begins. When the tribe set out on their way once again, a tribe member, a man old and worn-out by the years on his back, took refuge in the jungles, in the company of his beautiful daughter Yaríi.  One day, arrived, to the old man's hideaway, a strange man with strange skin and strange clothes, whom they welcomed with immense generosity.
        The old man offered to the man roasted acuti, a rodent, and a plate of tambu, made with wood eating larvae commonly raised by the Guarani in pindó logs.
        The legend say the visitor was sent by the god of kindness, that wanted to reward the great generosity showed to him, giving them something to offer every visitor that came by, something that would shorten the time of solitude spent in the banks of the rill where they lived. For them, he sprouted a new plant in the middle of the jungle, calling it Yaríi, and to the father he trusted it's safe guard and care, Cáa Yaráa, teaching him to dry the branches at the fire and to concoct a delicacy that he could offer to all new visitors. From then on, the new plant, offers it's leafs and branches to prepare the Mate.”

        As the Guarani migrated outwards they introduced the Erva Mate to other tribe in the south-east of South America, but in the south of Brazil and into to Uruguay they came into contact with the Charruas and Minuano peoples or nations, who later became the ones more intrinsically connected with Erva Mate. Not much is know about Charruas say for being a semi-nomadic people, and that they had resisted the Spanish invaders.

    <p>As they relied heavily on hunting and gathering they came into conflict with the Europeans colonizers how introduced the livestock, damaging the land and reducing their hunting and foraging range causing mass starvation and continuous fights with the colonizers, whom shot any native that came into site. Soon the Charruan people came to rely on sheep and cattle as their main source of food and trade with the invaders. But they still engaged in raids for the livestock against the Jesuits, which in turn employed the help of an enemy tribes to genocide the Charruas. The few who survived had interbred with the invader's cattleman and other natives forming a new group of people, the Gaúchos. And disgustingly the last pure Charruans died in france, in a human zoo.</p>

    <h3 class="backwhite">It's Transition And Corelation To Gaúcho Culture In South America</h3>
    <div class="backwhite">
    <p>As the Gaúchos came into proeminence in the XVIII century as cattle herders. During the XVIII century the colonizers employed the Gaúchos as peons and cattle herders in the Pampas, some even kept their ancestors fight against the invader but now for a similar yet different reason, raiding farmsteads and livestock, robbing caravans as they, the colonizers, crossed the Pampas. But as their forefathers they kept the Erva Mate as a social norm drinking it around the camp fire and eating meat, from short hunts or from the livestock they kept or raided, using long metal or more commonly wooden skewers to roast either a meat, giving birth to known worldwide Brazilian BBQ traditions. In those circles of barbecue and Mate the Gaúchos socialized and traded stories, tales history, and forming camaraderies amongst themselves.</p>

    <div class="backwhite">
    <p>The colonizers, in the XX began to adopt Gaúcho culture as their own, they soon became cultural identity of the Rio Grande do Sul, in the south of Brazil, as the modern Gaucho. Now the majority of the Gaúchos are formed out of mainly European descent having German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and even some Polish and little to none true Gaúcho blood. From them the Erva Mate became ever more popular in Rio Grande do Sul and through Brazil as a popular after lunch, mainly barbecue, and afternoon drink, and in more recent times, being known as Yerba-Mate tea abroad.</p>

    <h3 class="backwhite">Modern Consumption Of Erva Mate</h3>
    <div class="backwhite">
    <p>The Erva Mate became the social life blood of the Modern gaucho as it play a key roll in the after lunch and an afternoon social interactions, in the form of “Roda Do Chimarrão” where debates are held, talks about life, politics, social endeavours, as a Gaúcho saying goes “all who sit are equal in the chimarrão circle no-one is more no one is less”. A world travelling German doctor Robert Avelle Alema in 1858 said “The Mate is greeting for the arrival, is the symbol of hospitality, and is a symbol of reconciliation, every thing in our civilization that we understand as esteem, friendship, appreciation, every thing that is elevated and has a good and has a good impulse from the soul and heart, all of that is weaved in to the act of preparing Mate, serving it and drinking it in a group”. That statement still stands to this today as Gaúchos still hold dear to those social traditions, but sadly many have perverted those sacred traditions to exclude others that do not share their narrow-minded ideals, bigoted views and hate driven actions diminishing others. For those Gaúcho I say “I will not shun you from my circle but you will NOT disrespect, diminish or attack others in my circle, because you can't let go of a moronic past and cling to cruel and self-serving idealisms. And if you do, do not expect my help if their turn on you. You were warned.”</p>

    <p>But like many thing it still has it's unwanted effect that my turn you away from it, but remember some of these can be avoided, with moderation and respect for the drink a “good” amount to stop at  would be 1 L per day. Some of those effects are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As if in contradiction to the vascular dilator it may increase blood pressure due to the caffeine present in the mate and may not be recommended for people with hypertension and hypotension;</li>

    <p>
        Like in many tea ceremonies there are a variety of ways on how you should prepare the and for tea, but the case of Erva Mate being made into Chimarrão there is very little divergences in the making of it, as too many changes will result in issues to consume the Chimarrão and very noticeable flavour profile changes. But making it should not feel like chore, making it is supposed to be an enjoyable, calming and a relaxing experience as you go through the process. 
        Prior to making, or right before finishing, the preparation of the Chimarrão, as a recommendation, call a few friends and or family members, as to truly enjoy the Chimarrão at it's best, you'll want to form a chimarrão circle for the sharing experience, as many great conversations may arise from it, as physical and mental stimulate it will give you the enthusiasm to engage in a fun and unwinding dialogues that may go for hours without even noticing the passage of time.
        But as you make the chimarrão think of everything that lead to this moment from the first Guarani that discovered and spread the Erva Mate, to the Charruas fighting the Europeans and their subsequent mixing with the Minuanos and europeans to form the Gaúchos, and to this point in time where you are now. The chimarrão is a tool to remember and meditate on the past and present and the sacrifices that lead to the here and now and what you need to do to ensure the future for others that may come whom and whatever they may be. And YOU who ever you are, remember the past, act in the present and change the future.
