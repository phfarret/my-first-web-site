    <p class="backwhite">HELLO!!! Thank you for taking a time to know me. I'm Patrick H.F., I am a dual national Brazilian and English, that has been living in the UK for a while now. My intention with this web site is to bring you a bit of the culture, to bit more specific a drink, from the region of brazil that I originate from, the Chimarrão. I wish to inform you and teach you about the ceremony behind making and consuming it, and i hope you truly enjoy it!  </p>
